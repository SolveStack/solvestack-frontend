                            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will
                            be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are
                            set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact
                            same conditions unless you cancel it or SolveStack, LLC cancels it. You may cancel your
                            Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting
                            SolveStack, LLC customer support team.

                            payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically
                            authorize SolveStack, LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to
                            any such payment instruments.

                        <p>
                            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SolveStack, LLC will issue an
                            electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline
                            date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

                            Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the
                            applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
                        </p>

                            and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

                            for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the

                            Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such
                            change becomes effective.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
