        'In this course we are going to get you booted and ready to go as a software engineer who can make a project and put it onto the web for all to see. We’ve found that this is the best way to grab attention, as opposed to doing exercises. Plus, you’ll get to understand if doing the actual job is worth it for you, because you’ll have real experience. This basic website isn’t the kind of template you would use for a standard mom & pop shop’s website - there’s always a standard WordPress for that. If you are only interested in that, there is a different place for you. But, if you’re interested in preparing for a real software development job, then this website will build the necessary skills for you to start. This means our website will be considered a “web app.” Instead of an application on your desktop or PC, you are building an application inside a web browser. This means you can do a lot more than just “static” web content that doesn’t move. You can build interactive websites that accomplish a task over the internet! How cool is that?',
